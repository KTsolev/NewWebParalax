      <p>Ross has over 10 years experience in the industry. He is our Creative Director, digital designer, web designer and front-end developer. He is also pretty good with a sketchbook. Before starting the company Ross worked as a designer and studio manager for a design house who boasted a number of big name clients. Ross has brought his vast experience from this role to the work he does now.</p>

      <h1>Performance Aims</h1>
      <p>Minimise DOM interactions on scroll events.
      Ideally we should only be interacting with the parallax elements at the breakpoints (start & stop positions), so we can try to make use of CSS fixed positioning to accomplish the desired parallax effect. Obviously if we're adding a speed to the effect later on, whereby the element moves at say double the speed of scroll, we're going to need to update the position on every scroll event.
      Another important way of reducing the DOM interactions is to store all the static values from the parallax elements straight away when the page is loaded. The parallax settings defined in the HTML of each element will not change, so we would be sacrificing performance if we were grabbing these values on every scroll event.
      For more complex animations, use hardware accelleration where possible.
      Mobile devices are less powerful, which can cause jerkyness when dealing with animations applied dynamically through JavaScript. When we get to dealing with the speed property, we'll look at using transform properties to enable supported mobile devices to use the more powerful GPU to perform the animations.</p>

    <div class="paralaxSlides slide5"><h1>Performance Aims</h1></div>
    <div id="bind" class="subslide">
        <h1>Binding scroll and touchmove events</h1>
        <p>As touchmove events stop when your finger leaves the screen, but the browser will continue to scroll for around a second as part of the 'slowing down' easing effect. For this reason, I've decided to bind both the touchmove event and the scroll event. The bug you'll see is when you swipe past the end of the container and release your touch before the brick has hit the bottom, it overflows the container, and position: relative is only applied when the queued scroll events are fired when the scroll transition has ended.
          A solution for this problem (well, more of a workaround), is to design your parallax effects with this in mind. Consider placing an overlapping element with a higher z-index at the end point, so even if the brick overruns, it will be behind the higher element. If the overlapping element is tall enough, it should provide enough time for the scroll events to fire and position the brick relatively in the correct position.</p>

        $(document).ready(function () {
            ClickHandler();
        });
        $(window).on('scroll resize', CheckIfInView);
